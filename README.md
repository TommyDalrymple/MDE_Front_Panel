# MDE_Front_Panel
This contains the CAD models of the front panel. All the files needed are in this directory, a majority of them are the hardware models.

The hardware assembly is in the file "raspberry pi display.iam".

The prototype assembly is in the file "assembly_fp15.iam" and uses the files "sides_fp15.ipt", "center_fp15.ipt", and "raspberry pi display.iam". 

The new design assembly is in the file "assembly_fp16.iam". Changes were only made to the console section, so the files used in this assembly are "sides_fp15.ipt",
"center_fp16.ipt", and "rasberry pi display.iam".

All other files are used for the hardware assembly.
